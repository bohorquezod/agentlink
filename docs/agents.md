# Agents Documentation Index

Central entry point for agent-related documentation across supported platforms.

## Agents Docs by Platform

- OpenCode: [`docs/opencode/agents.md`](./opencode/agents.md)
- Cursor (subagents): [`docs/cursor/agents.md`](./cursor/agents.md)
- Claude (subagents): [`docs/claude/agents.md`](./claude/agents.md)

## Quick Navigation

| If you need to... | Open |
| --- | --- |
| Configure OpenCode primary agents, subagents, tools, and permissions | [`docs/opencode/agents.md`](./opencode/agents.md) |
| Design Cursor subagents, delegation behavior, and parallel/background execution | [`docs/cursor/agents.md`](./cursor/agents.md) |
| Configure Claude subagents with tools, permissions, memory, hooks, and isolation | [`docs/claude/agents.md`](./claude/agents.md) |

## Terminology Note

Some platforms use **subagents** as the primary concept for specialized delegated execution. This index uses "agents" as the umbrella term and links to each platform's native terminology.

## Scope of This File

This file intentionally avoids duplicating platform details. It only centralizes agent-related entry points so you can jump to the correct platform documentation quickly.
